> This little repo was made because I'm too lazy to keep building a project from scratch... and also to learn a bit about bash script.

## :question: What is this about?

This repo is a collection of bash scripts created to automate the project base with Next.js, just to use and be happy :)

### :interrobang: How can you use it?

It's actually very simple, you only have to click the "Use this template" button up there :arrow_up: or down here :arrow_down: to make a copy to your GitHub

[![Use this template](./_docs/use-this-template-btn.png)](https://github.com/SlyCooper-n/models/generate)

But you can go by CLI too

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SlyCooper-n/models.git

# or
gh repo clone SlyCooper-n/models
```

After you have this on your machine, do the following:

```bash
# this will run the sript to create a new project
bash models/ctnewpj.sh
```

## :inbox_tray: Arguments
